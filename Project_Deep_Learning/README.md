In this project, I used deep learning method to build a system which can detect apparels people wear in video and find the most similar clothes image in the database. I scraped a lot of fashion image online to trained a convolutional neural network (cnn) by transferred learning from ResNet-50 for fashion image classification which has accuracy up to 76%. I also built a recognition system to discover human in video based on an existed human body detected model called Haar Cascades. The recognition system is used to screen the video frame. The validated frame should be clear and contain only one person with a full upper body. Then the trained convolutional neural network generated feature vectors for both apparel images in database and the video frame screened by the recognition systems. The last step is measuring the similarity between apparel image in the database and the apparel in video according to cosine similarity and finding the most similar pair.
