In this project, I worked on exploratory data analysis utilizing foot traffic data of subway stations of NYC.
My goal is to study the change pattern of foot traffic in each subway station and find out the subway stations with the most foot traffic volume, then depicting the change pattern by graphs.
This project emphasizes data preprocessing and manipulation (cleaning, parsing and organizing)and finding characteristics of the data.
I retrieved the data from MTA website http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html.
There are four main steps to complete the projects.
1) Retrieving data from MTA website.
2) Preprocessing the data.
3) Finding the change pattern of the foot traffic for the subway stations.
4) Comparing foot traffic among the subway stations.

Main Python packages:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib.
