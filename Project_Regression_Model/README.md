In this project, I analyzed the factors affecting university ranking by regression models. I scraped web data for more than 150 universities including their ranking information, teaching level score, research level score, number of students, citation number, the average salary of graduates, student to faculty ratio, etc from more than eight websites.Â After cleaning and organizing the raw data, I applied regression models including linear regression with regularization, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting to predict the ranking score of universities based on the feature information. The models achieved the accuracy of 84%. I also interpreted the results by analyzing the key features of schools with high correlation to the ranking and validating my interpretation by finding related references (news, reports and research papers).

Two Jupyter notebook files and a DataFrame in Pickle format are provided.
