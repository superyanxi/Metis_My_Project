In this project, I built a personalized coupon recommendation system for Ponpare, a leading Japanese coupon online-store.
I analyzed the records for 240,000+ customers including their transaction records, browsing histories and profile information (i.e., age, gender, location). After data cleaning, I organized above data into a large Dataframe for classification model training.
The model is used for predicting how likely a certain customer would buy each coupon he/she had seen on the website. The classification model was incorporated into the recommendation systems. By inputting the profile information of customers and the type of coupon the customers would like to purchase, the system would recommend the coupons the customers are most likely to buy.

Two Jupyter notebook files and a Dataframe in Pickle format are provided.
