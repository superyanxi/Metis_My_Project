Hi I am Yanxi.  I would like to show you four of my machine learning projects covering Regression Analysis, Regression analysis, Natural Language Process and Deep Learning Analysis for image process.Project 1: Analysis of Factors Affecting University Ranking (Regression Analysis)In this project, I analyzed the factors affecting university ranking by regression modeling. I scrapped web data for more than 150 universities including their ranking information, teaching level score, research level score, number of students, citation number, the average salary of graduates, student to faculty ratio, etc from more than eight websites. After cleaning and organizing the raw data, I applied regression models including linear regression with regularization, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting to predict the ranking score of universities based on the feature information. The model achieved the accuracy of 84%. I also interpreted the results by analyzing the key features of schools with high correlation to school ranking and tried to validate my interpretation by finding related references (news, reports and research papers).Project2: Building Product Recommendation System for Customers in Ponpare (Classification Analysis)In this project, I trained a classification model to build a recommendation system for the customers in Ponpare, a leading Japanese coupon online-store. I analyzed the information of 22,783 users including their transaction records, browsing histories and profile information (i.e., age, gender, location). After data cleaning, I organized above data into one big dataframe used for training model. I built a machine learning pipeline using classification models including Random Forest, KNN and Gradient Boosting to achieve 78% accuracy. This model is used to predict how likely the transaction will happen for a given user and coupon combination. The system will recommend the coupon the user is most likely to buy. I also build a flask app based on javascript to visualize the recommendation systems.  Project3: Building Journal Finder for Researchers (Natural Language Process)This project is about Natural Language Processing. I built a journal finder system for researchers who are looking for journals to publish their papers. What researcher needs to do is inputting the abstract of the paper to the system, and the journal finder will recommend the journal are most similar to the input abstract. To build the database of abstract, I used API to get more than 8000 abstracts from a publisher website called Elsevier. After preprocessing, I used TF-IDF and LSI to convert text into the numeric vector with reduced dimension. Then LDA was applied to turn the abstract into a numeric vector in topic space. Two type of feature vectors obtained from TF-IDF and LDA were fed to a classification model, which can predict which journal the abstract belongs to. The classification model based on random forest model achieves the accuracy of 85%. I also made a flask app for visualization of the systems.   Project4: Searching Similar Clothes to the Apparel in Video (Deep Learning Analysis)In this project, I used deep learning method to build a system which can detect apparels people wear in video and find the most similar clothes image in the database. I scraped a lot of fashion image online to trained a convolutional neural network (cnn) by transferred learning from ResNet-50 for fashion image classification which has accuracy up to 76%. I also built a recognition system to discover fashion apparel in video based on an existed human body detected model called Haar Cascades. The recognition system is used to screen the video frame. The validated frame should be clear and contain a person with a full upper body. Then the trained convolutional neural network generated feature vectors for both apparel images in database and the video frame screened by the recognition systems. The last step is measuring the similarity between apparel image in the database and the apparel in video according to cosine similarity and finding the most similar pair.
